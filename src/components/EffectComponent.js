// ? You need to pass two arguments to useEffect:
// ? A setup function with setup code that connects to that system.
// ? It should return a cleanup function with cleanup code that disconnects from that system.
// ? A list of dependencies including every value from your component used inside of those functions.

// ? React calls your setup and cleanup functions whenever itâ€™s necessary, which may happen multiple times:
// ? Your setup code runs when your component is added to the page (mounts).
// ? After every re-render of your component where the dependencies have changed:
// ? First, your cleanup code runs with the old props and state.
// ? Then, your setup code runs with the new props and state.
// ? Your cleanup code runs one final time after your component is removed from the page (unmounts).
